# Machine Learning Analysis on Vocal Features for Parkinson's Disease

This repository contains a machine learning analysis script focusing on vocal features to detect Parkinson's disease in a case-control experimental setup.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the required R packages. You can do this by executing the following commands:
```R
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
install_github("kassambara/factoextra")
install.packages("scatterplot3d")
install.packages("e1071")
```
## Parkinson's Disease (PD) Speech Dataset

The PD database comprises both training and test files, with the training data collected from 20 individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PWP) and 20 healthy individuals at the Department of Neurology in Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University. The dataset includes multiple types of sound recordings, such as sustained vowels, numbers, words, and short sentences, extracted from 26 voice samples of each subject. Additionally, 26 linear and timeâ€“frequency-based features are extracted from each voice sample.
For additional details, please refer to the following reference:

O., 'Collection and Analysis of a Parkinson Speech Dataset with Multiple Types of Sound
Recordings', IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, vol. 17(4), pp. 828-834, 2013

### Training Data File
Each subject in the training dataset has 26 voice samples, including sustained vowels, numbers, words, and short sentences. The voice samples are organized in the following order:

- 1-3: Sustained vowel (aaa...)
- 4-13: Numbers from 1 to 10
- 14-17: Short sentences
- 18-26: Words

### Test Data File
In the test dataset, 28 PD patients were asked to say sustained vowels 'a' and 'o' three times each, resulting in a total of 168 recordings. The voice samples in the test data file are given in the following order:

- 1-3: Sustained vowel (aaa...)
- 4-6: Sustained vowel (ooo...)

### Features
- 2-27: Features
  - Features 1-5: Jitter (local), Jitter (local, absolute), Jitter (rap), Jitter (ppq5), Jitter (ddp)
  - Features 6-11: Shimmer (local), Shimmer (local, dB), Shimmer (apq3), Shimmer (apq5), Shimmer (apq11), Shimmer (dda)
  - Features 12-14: AC, NTH, HTN
  - Features 15-19: Median pitch, Mean pitch, Standard deviation, Minimum pitch, Maximum pitch
  - Features 20-23: Number of pulses, Number of periods, Mean period, Standard deviation of period
  - Features 24-26: Fraction of locally unvoiced frames, Number of voice breaks, Degree of voice breaks

## Method
The method is the following:
  -  Merge the legacy train and test data.
  -  Aggregate in a new dataset the different kinds of audio samples from the same patient (more below).
  -  Split the dataset in a new Train and Test, with better distribution of case and control.
  -  (Not necessary) Check for redundancy in features of Train: for each features couple the whose correlation is higher than a treshold, discard (in both the datasets) one of the two.
  -  Perform PCA analysis on the filtered Train data, retrieving PCA Coefficients.
  -  Project Train data in the PCA Space.
  -  Train the SVM Model over the Train PCA Projections.
  -  Project Test data in the PCA Space, using the Train PCA Coefficients.
  -  Check the Model performance (Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity).

The method is then repeated for all the kinds of aggregation of the samples from the same patient, the features used to aggregate the dataset are the following :

Mean, Standard Deviation, Energy, RMS


 
The averages results of the model with a train set constructed over these features are then printed to screen.
The results are visualized with scatter plots and decision boundaries.

</p>

Testing shows that Standard Deviation of the vocal features over different samples yields the best results in the metrics, with a top score of : 

  "Accuracy : 0.8448"
  
  "Precision : 0.9291"
  
  "Sensitivity : 0.8262"
  
  "Cumulative Score : 2.6001"
  
## Code
The code is structured in a main script that has the task specific instructions, the other scripts are more versatile and could be adapted fairly easily to any dataset.

Functions to visualize PCA Projections and SVM Models results are also included.

Feel free to adapt the script to your specific dataset and requirements. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!
